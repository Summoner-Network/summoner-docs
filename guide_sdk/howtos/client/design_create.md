<!-- 
# Configuration
Best practive if unsure

# Structure
- agent.py
- requirements.txt
- folders, etc.. 
- databases

# Plan for crashs and messages not received
 - fsm logic
 - design strategies
    - start simple: travel and function
    - decompose function into task and:
        - valiation 
        - registration 
        - message processing

NOTE: Rely on the agent libraires to give easy examples and then link to the more complex ones


Make remark on starved message: try to account for failure (refer to async_db.md)


I need to refer to `summoner-agent` here -- this is the right place. I would need to describe what agent demonstrate (what feature, and I might also refer to the SDK reference) -->
