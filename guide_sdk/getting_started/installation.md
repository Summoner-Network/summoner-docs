# Installation of the Summoner SDK

Because the Summoner SDK is composed of multiple repositories, we do **not** currently support installation via package registries like PyPI. Instead, we use Bash-based installation scripts to manage setup and composition.

This script-based approach is consistent across key components of the platform, including:

* [`summoner-desktop`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-desktop): the Electron-based desktop app
* [`summoner-core`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-core): the core logic of the SDK
* [`summoner-creatures`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-creatures): agent extensions and features

Each of these repositories contains its own `setup.sh`, `install.sh` or build script, and these scripts **chain together** during installation. For example, installing the SDK via `summoner-desktop` will trigger the `summoner-sdk` script, which in turn calls the setup scripts from `summoner-core` and any modules specified in `build.txt`.


## A Template-Based SDK

The [`summoner-sdk`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-sdk) repository is a **GitHub template repository**, meaning users should not modify it directly. Instead, use GitHub‚Äôs "Use this template" feature to generate a new repository that includes only the installation logic.

You then customize your new SDK by editing the `build.txt` file to specify which modules to include. This modular architecture allows for many valid SDK compositions based on different combinations of features surrounding the SDK core.

</p>

> üì¶ The default `build.txt` in the template includes:
>
> * `summoner-smart-tools` (currently private)
> * `summoner-creatures` (public)

A best practice is to only publish new code or features specific to your SDK, and keep the actual installation logic clean and declarative through `build.txt`. For example, [`summoner-agents`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-agents) is built from this template and contains only agent code ‚Äî the SDK is installed via `build_sdk.sh` based on its own `build.txt`.


## Python and Rust Installation

The installation scripts used in this process include:

* [`build_sdk.sh`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-sdk/blob/main/build_sdk.sh) (from `summoner-sdk`)
* [`setup.sh`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-core/blob/main/setup.sh) (from `summoner-core`)
* [`reinstall_python_sdk.sh`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-core/blob/main/reinstall_python_sdk.sh)
* [`reinstall_rust_server.sh`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-core/blob/main/reinstall_rust_server.sh)

These scripts assume you already have **Python 3.9+** and **Rust** installed. If not, follow the instructions below (also detailed in the `summoner-core` README):

### 1. Install Python

Check your current Python version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is not installed, install it using your system's package manager:

**On macOS:**

```bash
brew install python
```

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip
```


### 2. Install Rust

Install Rust using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs):

**On macOS (via Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install rustup
rustup-init
```

**On macOS/Linux (via curl):**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Restart your terminal and verify:

```bash
rustc --version     # Should print the Rust compiler version
cargo --version     # Should print the Cargo package manager version
```


## üîß Build the SDK with a Custom `build.txt`

Once Python and Rust are installed, you can define your SDK composition and install it.

### Step 1: Create Your SDK Repository

1. Go to the [`summoner-sdk` template repository](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-sdk)
2. Click **"Use this template"**
3. Choose **"Create a new repository"**, name your project, and confirm

<p align="center">
  <img width="450px" src="../../assets/img/use_template.png" alt="Use this template button screenshot" />
</p>

Clone your new repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_account>/<your_repo>.git
cd <your_repo>
```


### Step 2: Define the SDK in `build.txt`

Edit the `build.txt` file to include the modules you want. For example, to include the `kobold` agent module from `summoner-creatures`:

```txt
https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-creatures.git:
kobold
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è As of this writing, the `kobold` module is still under development. Full support for agent behavior will be available soon.

You can modify this file at any time to add or remove modules.


### Step 3: Run the Installer

<p align="center">
  <img width="550px" src="../../assets/gifs/sdk_installation.gif" alt="Summoner architecture diagram" />
</p>

Once `build.txt` is configured, run the script:

```bash
source build_sdk.sh setup
```

This will:

* Create a Python `venv/`
* Install all required Python and Rust dependencies
* Pull in the requested features defined in `build.txt`
* Link them together into a functional SDK workspace

If you prefer to execute the script instead of sourcing it:

```bash
bash build_sdk.sh setup
source venv/bin/activate
```

You are now ready to begin development using your custom Summoner SDK.
