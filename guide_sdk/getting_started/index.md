## Getting Started

The Summoner platform is designed to help you create and run intelligent agents, with a focus on modularity and local-first development. It consists of two core components:

* **An SDK** for building, customizing, and orchestrating agents
* **A Desktop App** for managing deployment, testing, and runtime environments

To begin, you can clone the [`summoner-sdk`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-sdk) repository, which contains everything you need to create and run agents. If you prefer managing agents through a graphical interface, visit the [`summoner-desktop`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-desktop) repository. The desktop app is fully functional today, though future versions may require account creation for cloud features.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking to install and use the desktop app, refer to the [Desktop App Guide](../../guide_app/index.md).
>
> This section of the documentation focuses on the SDK: how to install it, run clients and servers locally, and use sample agents from the [`summoner-agents`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-agents) repository.

The SDK is modular by design. It is built around a core library (`summoner-core`) and includes optional components that you can add or remove as needed. We will showcase the SDK using both its core modules and common extensions â€” for example, the agent classes from [`summoner-creatures`](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-creatures), which add decentralized identity, cryptographic tools, and other runtime capabilities.
