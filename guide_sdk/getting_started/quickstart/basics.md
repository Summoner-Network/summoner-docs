# Basics

Summoner is a **protocol** for secure, reliable communication between independent agents.
Let us briefly review what a protocol is, and why it matters for coordination.

## What is a Protocol?

A protocol defines the rules that enable effective communication and coordination. Protocols determine:

* How messages are formatted and sent.
* How silence, delays, or errors are handled.
* The expectations and behavior of all participating components.


Without clear protocols, systems become inefficient or fail entirely.

## Clients vs. Servers

> [!NOTE] 
> **Definition.** A _client_ is a program that initiates a connection to a server to send requests and receive responses.  
> **Definition.** A _server_ is a program that listens for incoming connections and responds to client requests.

In the Summoner platform, clients form the basis of agents, while servers act as coordination points where multiple agents can connect and exchange messages. For more details, see the sections on [clients](basics_client.md) and [servers](basics_server.md).


## Summoner in Practice

Summoner builds on TCP, a foundational **internet protocol** introduced in the 1970s, to ensure reliable communication between agents and servers. TCP handles low-level concerns like connection ordering, retransmission, and data integrity â€” allowing Summoner to focus on higher-level structures like identities, cryptographic envelopes, and asynchronous coordination.

<!-- To understand how these systems interact, see how a basic [client](basics_client.md) or [server](basics_server.md) connects via TCP. The [Beginner's Guide](begin.md) explains how Summoner servers and clients are structured on top of these basics. -->

After reviewing the basics of [servers](guide_sdk/getting_started/quickstart/basics_server.md) and [clients](guide_sdk/getting_started/quickstart/basics_client.md) in the Summoner platform, we will examine how these components can be set up and executed in practice in the [Beginner's Guide](begin.md).
