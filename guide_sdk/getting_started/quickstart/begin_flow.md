# Orchestrating Agent Behavior Using Flows

Very light code use, but overview is good (with many insights if possible)

Just explain the theory and mainly WHY
- TCP: Some messages are starved and listenning needs to be a loop until it triggers
- Explain travel: States make it is easy to compose: 

## Finite state machines 


## Category theory


## Higher structures



There is also a lot to unpack in temrs of imports (protocol" process, flow, signals)


Compare to smart contract and events released when something is done (rewatch or guide to the videos?)

# Beginner's Guide to Agent Flows

> Understand why Summoner models agent logic as flows, and how FSMs, higher abstractions, and protocol layers enable composable, reliable behaviors.

**Purpose & audience**  
- **Who:** anyone curious about the “why” behind Summoner's flow model  
- **What:** core theory—FSMs, composability, and emerging patterns  
- **Outcome:** grasp why flows simplify complex protocols and how to leverage them  

---

## 1. Why Flows?

- **TCP quirks**  
  - TCP delivers streams, not discrete messages  
  - Agents must loop, buffer, and multiplex until a logical “message” emerges  
- **Composability**  
  - Breaking behavior into states and transitions makes it easier to mix, match, and reuse  
- **Reliability**  
  - Explicit state diagrams catch edge cases (timeouts, retries) early  

> **Sample copy:**  
> “Instead of writing ad-hoc loops to read bytes and parse messages, Summoner lets you declare a sequence of named states. The framework handles low-level I/O, so you focus on ‘what happens next.'”

---

## 2. Finite State Machines (FSMs)

- **States**  
  - Named stages in your agent's lifecycle (e.g. `idle`, `asking`, `responding`)  
- **Transitions**  
  - Triggered by messages or timeouts  
  - Expressed as routes (e.g. `"idle → asking"`)  
- **Benefits**  
  - Clear visual diagrams  
  - Predictable behavior under network failures  

```python
@agent.receive(route="idle → asking")
async def on_ask(msg):
    # move from idle to asking
```

> **Copy-template:**
> “FSMs let you map out every possible step. If a message arrives out of order, you'll know exactly which state handler should catch it.”

---

## 3. Category-Inspired Composition

* **Morphisms as transitions**

  * Each route is like an arrow in a category, connecting objects (states)
* **Composition law**

  * You can chain routes (`a→b`, `b→c`) to form larger workflows
* **Identity & associativity**

  * “Do nothing” transitions and grouping steps don't change the overall flow

> **Sample copy:**
> “By treating states as objects and transitions as morphisms, Summoner guarantees that combining two flows yields another valid flow. This algebraic view underpins safe, reusable patterns.”

---

## 4. Higher-Order Structures

* **Monads for side-effects**

  * Encapsulate I/O, logging, retries within your flow steps
* **Functors for branching**

  * Map a single event into parallel paths (e.g. multicast)
* **Applicatives for combining**

  * Run multiple independent transitions in lockstep

> **Copy-template:**
> “Although you write handlers one at a time, under the hood flows can be lifted into richer abstractions—letting you batch, fork, or sequence operations uniformly.”

---

## 5. Putting It All Together

1. **Define states** in your head or on a whiteboard.
2. **Annotate handlers** with clear routes.
3. **Let Summoner** manage the TCP loop, buffering, and dispatch.
4. **Compose flows** by reusing state names and route patterns across agents.

> **Sample copy:**
> “Whether building a chat bot, a game NPC, or a multi-party protocol, think in terms of small, testable transitions. Summoner's flow engine then glues them into a resilient whole.”
