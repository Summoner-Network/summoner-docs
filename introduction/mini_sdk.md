        - function
            - decorator
        - multifunctoin
        - signal based: receive(), send()
            - hardcoded
            - autonomous

    - Why use Network:
        - loading a model (word2vec) can take time - loading it once and having it available as an api call is great to work on this
        - Summoner: open to any other context
            - loading model
            - two computers: one with GPUs
