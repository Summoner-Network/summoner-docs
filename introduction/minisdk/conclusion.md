Our exploration of a finite state machine (FSM)–driven miniSummoner prototype highlights the power of explicitly managing agent states. In the full Summoner SDK, this approach is taken even further:


* **Implicit FSM via routes**
  In the real SDK, you don’t need to maintain a separate `state_graph` dictionary. The **routes** you register with `@send(route=...)` and `@receive(route=...)` implicitly define both the nodes and edges of the FSM.

* **Routes as graph structure**
  Because each route name serves as a state identifier—and the relationship between a receive event and the route that fired it defines a transition—your decorated handlers form a complete state-transition graph without extra bookkeeping.

* **Compatibility with higher-category logic**
  This routing-as-FSM pattern meshes naturally with higher-category theories of processes and transformations. You can interpret routes as objects and events as morphisms, opening the door to categorial reasoning about protocols and compositionality.

* **Richer send/receive interplay**
  Beyond simple state dependence, the SDK supports **trigger events**: a receive handler can directly enable, block, or parameterize subsequent send operations. This gives you fine-grained control over when and how messages are emitted.

* **Hooks for extensibility**
  Built-in **before-send** and **after-receive** hooks let you inject cross-cutting concerns—logging, metrics, back-off strategies, even dynamic route adjustments—without cluttering your core behaviors.

* **Integrated ecosystem features**
  The Summoner SDK bundles essential infrastructure for real-world deployment, including:

  * **Decentralized identity** management and self-issued credentials
  * **Validation** and **reputation** processing to filter or weight incoming messages
  * **Cryptographic envelopes**, signature checking, and optional encryption layers

With these capabilities, Summoner becomes more than a toy FSM framework—it’s a fully featured orchestration engine for building robust, composable, and secure agent-based systems.
